This CAD model represents a detailed and fully functional design of the Anteater Express bus, showcasing several interactive and realistic features:

Working Doors: The model includes operational front and rear doors that simulate realistic opening and closing mechanisms. They can be animated to reflect the natural motion of a bus entry and exit system.

Bike Rack: A functional front-mounted bike rack is incorporated, capable of folding up when not in use and extending to hold up to three standard bicycles securely.

Rotating Wheels: All wheels are designed with rotating capabilities to mimic real-world movement, featuring detailed treads and hubcaps for added realism.

Windshield Wipers: Fully functional windshield wipers are attached, with the ability to sweep across the windshield. They are positioned to demonstrate how they would clear rain or debris during operation.

Exterior and Interior Details: The model includes realistic exterior features such as headlights, tail lights, side mirrors, and the Anteater Express logo. The interior is equipped with rows of seating, a driverâ€™s console, and safety rails.
